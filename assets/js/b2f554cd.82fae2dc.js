DNA is double-stranded (the spare strand can be used for fixing errors)\\n - multiple copies of chromosomes\\n - Species are populations with multiple copies\\n\\nCultural systems use:\\n - writing\\n - visual art\\n - music and spoken word\\n - places as physical anchors/markers/symbols\\n - others?\\n - digital storage of words, videos, sounds\\n\\nWe think of think of written words as having more durability than spoken word but:\\n - languages evolve over time and reach a point where we cannot read the writing even if in stone (rosetta stone needed for Egyptian hieroglyphs)\\n - written word is archival unless read or spoken\\n - written/carved words can be burnt/destroyed/decayed by time\\n\\nAs long as the words (stories and songs) are spoken and sung in each generation, then the persistence is potentially forever.\\n\\n\\nThus:\\n\\n - deep time cultures must minimize large-scale wars as these cause genocide and thus erasure of deep-time information\\n - shallow-time cultures may not have the larger collective awareness of the long-term consequence of such loss events\\n - parasitic elements of deep time entities can consume the stored entropy of complex information (akin to, or literally, burning books for warmth)"},{"id":"metapages-history","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/metapages-history","editUrl":"https://github.com/metapages/docs.metapage.io/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2022-12-05-metapages-history.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2022-12-05-metapages-history.mdx","title":"Metapages Origin","description":"Metapages are a way to solve problems that arose repeatedly during my work in different multi-disciplinary scientific+software workplaces.","date":"2022-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 5, 2022","tags":[{"label":"history","permalink":"/blog/tags/history"},{"label":"metapages","permalink":"/blog/tags/metapages"}],"readingTime":1.545,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Dion Whitehead","title":"Metapages Founder","url":"https://github.com/dionjwa","imageURL":"https://github.com/dionjwa.png","key":"dion"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"metapages-history","title":"Metapages Origin","authors":["dion"],"tags":["history","metapages"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Greatest Information Technology of Humans","permalink":"/blog/greatest-tech-in-time"},"nextItem":{"title":"Deep Time Organization","permalink":"/blog/metapages-deep-time"}},"content":"Metapages are a way to solve problems that arose repeatedly during my work in different multi-disciplinary scientific+software workplaces.\\n\\nProblems and observations:\\n\\n -
