In basic terms, Docker is a technology that allows you to create and run virtual computer systems within any other system. This is powerful because in this system, called a container, you can install exactly the software needed to run code, and the same docker container is identical no matter what system it is run on, so your code will always work, no matter where or when you run it. This powerful technology can be leveraged in metaframes with custom docker containers or configurations, allowing you to run virtually any code you can imagine. The applications are endless! To get you started with Docker in metaframes, let\u2019s go through the simple example of creating a word cloud with python.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Getting-Started/your-first-metapage":{"id":"Getting-Started/your-first-metapage","title":"Creating your first metapage","description":"Once you\u2019ve entered the metapage.io site and created an account you are now ready to create your first metapage.
