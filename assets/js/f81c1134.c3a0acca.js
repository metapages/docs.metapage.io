The worker takes the docker image definition, and builds the image, then runs the code+data in the container environment. This browser client is actually a component, and can be connected to other browser components to exchange data.\\n\\n\\nFor a complete example showing a docker container running a ML workflow and producing visual output: [https://metapage.io/dion/Python-ML-Workflow-385b95ab9cb04fa7a76df627b2bde668](https://metapage.io/dion/Python-ML-Workflow-385b95ab9cb04fa7a76df627b2bde668)\\n\\n\\n## User experience {#194018579bb580be8653efea408daf81}\\n\\n\\nAs long as there is compute resources attached, users then do not have to manually install anything, or worry about their host system: the definition defined in the URL contains everything needed to reproduce the compute environment, and connectable from the browser.\\n\\n\\nUsers can then take existing compute environments, complete with code, and directly modify, copy, and share these environments, directly as you would any other URL, or via our [index of components](https://metapage.io/)\\n\\n\\n## How it works {#194018579bb5806aae41ee7529a1f9cf}\\n\\n\\n[See here for detailed instructions](https://docs.metapage.io/docs/containers)\\n\\n\\nWe provide an open and open-source compute queue API layer, where any user can create their own secure queue, connect their computer, and run docker containers and code all defined in a single URL.\\n\\n\\nThe URL contains the `Dockerfile`  definition, or a publicly accessible docker image, optionally code, optionally a github repository to build from.\\n\\n\\nThis way, the mechanism to build a reproducible compute environment is simply a URL, where users simply add their own commodity compute resources (their laptop, workstation, cluster, almost anything that can run docker containers).\\n\\n\\nIf the user wanted to run their own complete system that is different, they can, because the definition of the compute environment is encoded into the URL, thus available for all. \\n\\n\\n```mermaid\\ngraph LR\\n  a[\\"Storage \u2705 but compute \ud83d\uded1\\"] \\n  b[\\"FAIR but for compute\\"]\\n  a --\x3e b\\n  click a \\"/blog/blob-storage-is-solved-but-what-about-compute\\"\\n  click b \\"/blog/fair-data-what-about-compute\\"\\n  style b fill:#fff,stroke:#999999,stroke-width:2px,color:#000\\n```"},{"id":"/competition-1-1","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/competition-1-1","source":"@site/blog/Competitions/competition-1-1.mdx","title":"Competion 1.1","description":"This competition is closed!

Now I don\u2019t (much): when I build an app or website, that needs some blob storage my thoughts are:\\n\\n1. create a bucket or whatever it\u2019s called in one of some cloud provider, doesn\u2019t have to be the biggest name, they\u2019re all very reliable\\n2. put stuff in\\n3. get stuff out\\n\\nI don\u2019t care where much it is. Why? Because it\u2019s a **solved problem**. Remote blob storage is:\\n\\n- very cheap, and getting cheaper\\n- reliable [1]\\n\\nAt scale however, yes, you do have to think about cost, but those calculations are pretty straightforward business calculations. At anything below very large data, you don\u2019t have to think much about it, and this makes it a **solved problem**.\\n\\n\\nIt\u2019s a solved problem in a similar way that nature has solved storing information: replication, with automated mechanisms for damage repair/reconciliation [2].\\n\\n\\n## Compute is not a solved problem {#7998c587d99540c98564ff6646cb9977}\\n\\n\\nBecause you have to think about it. What I want: \\n\\n\\nI give you some application, some workflow, for example, a machine learning agent, some program I have created, some tool, and it requires from time to time, some level of computing power. You are able to automatically, safely, connect that application to the right level of compute resources as needed.\\n\\n- If the program is in the browser, I might be able to use the GPU, while the tab is open and running.\\n- If the program is downloaded and installed program, I have access to your entire computer, but due to that, security and parasitic programs become a problem.\\n- If I make available some cloud computing, it suddenly becomes complex, with lots of decisions, but with lots of scalable compute resources of different useful types.\\n\\nComputing resources are inherently valuable, and often able to be converted to $$ efficiently via automation.\\n\\n\\nObviously `storage !== compute` but if it were as easy, then I could distribute complex scientific simulations, and revive them years later, and they would \u201cjust work\u201d.\\n\\n\\nThe team at [https://metapage.io](https://metapage.io/) aim to solve that problem: compute as a simple commodity.\\n\\n\\nWhen we can treat compute as a commodity, we have more power over the compute providers. When they manage to get their system to be difficult to move from, you lose bargaining power.\\n\\n\\nPersonally, I default to [https://www.digitalocean.com/](https://www.digitalocean.com/). This isn\u2019t a paid plug! They just do a great job of making plenty of options, at the right complexity/resolution, not too many, not too few.\\n\\n\\nFor my full stacks, I\u2019m using AWS but not directly: my choice of platform vendor ([https://nhost.io](https://nhost.io/)) makes that decision for me.\\n\\n\\n# References {#f72739ff70d843c7b655beb4d3c9c218}\\n\\n\\n### [1] **How data is lost in the cloud** {#5ff5b92126b14c0cb53ba25f3a9f00d3}\\n\\n\\n[https://spanning.com/blog/how-data-is-lost-in-the-cloud/](https://spanning.com/blog/how-data-is-lost-in-the-cloud/)\\n\\n\\n### [2] **Mechanisms of ionizing-radiation resistance** {#7d4f1319505a45ddb4c4b1a2e8c47ceb}\\n\\n\\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinococcus_radiodurans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinococcus_radiodurans)\\n\\n\\n```mermaid\\ngraph LR\\n  a[\\"Storage \u2705 but compute \ud83d\uded1\\"] \\n  b[\\"FAIR but for compute\\"]\\n  a --\x3e b\\n  click a \\"/blog/blob-storage-is-solved-but-what-about-compute\\"\\n  style a fill:#fff,stroke:#999999,stroke-width:2px,color:#000\\n  click b \\"/blog/fair-data-what-about-compute\\"\\n```"},{"id":"/internet-archive-url-configured-websites","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/internet-archive-url-configured-websites","source":"@site/blog/internet-archive-url-configured-websites.mdx","title":"The Internet Archive and URL configured websites","description":"Links are critical to deep-time knowledge preservation","date":"2023-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"The Internet Archive and URL configured websites","sidebar_position":17,"slug":"/internet-archive-url-configured-websites","date":"2023-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","hide_table_of_contents":true},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Blob storage is a solved problem- what about compute?","permalink":"/blog/blob-storage-is-solved-but-what-about-compute"},"nextItem":{"title":"URL Configured Websites","permalink":"/blog/url-configured-websites"}},"content":"Links are critical to deep-time knowledge preservation\\n\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n\\n# The Internet Archive and Deep-Time {#141c30a529cd48358db20933014bda26}\\n\\n\\n```mermaid\\nflowchart\\n\\tn1[\\"knowledge\\"]\\n\\tn2[\\"is NOT\\"]\\n\\tn3[\\"here\\"]\\n\\tn1 --\x3e  n2  --\x3e  n3 --\x3e n1\\n\\n\\tk1[\\"_\\"]\\n\\tk2[\\"_\\"]\\n\\tk3[\\"_\\"]\\n\\tk1 --\x3e |\\"knowledge\\"| k3  --\x3e |\\"exists\\"| k2 --\x3e |\\"here\\"| k1\\n\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\nThe [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) is a critical piece of the internet.

When a link to a website dies for whatever reason, but then is preserved, we keep the underlying knowledge, since knowledge is distributed, just like how awareness of the environment is somehow kept in the patterns of neuron connections, not stored someone inside specific neurons.\\n\\n\\n:::note\\n\\nDigital neurons store information patterns in the connections.
