Metapages are powerful because they combine flexibility, simplicity, and collaboration\u2014all within a single webpage. Through the following tutorials, you\u2019ll gain hands-on experience with creating, customizing, and sharing Metapages for various applications.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Getting-Started/python-pyodide-walkthrough":{"id":"Getting-Started/python-pyodide-walkthrough","title":"Running Python with Pyodide","description":"Pyodide is a python package that allows you to run lightweight python code directly in the browser. This makes it perfect for simple applications where we want to run python code in a metaframe without having to use a docker container. In this walkthrough we will use python with pyodide to generate a plot and display the image it generates.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Getting-Started/working-with-docker-metaframes":{"id":"Getting-Started/working-with-docker-metaframes","title":"Working with docker metaframes","description":"Now that you know how to create simple metapages, from adding metaframes and constructing data connections between them, to uploading and displaying images and running python with pyodide and displaying its output in a linked metaframe, we will now learn how to use one of the most powerful tools in metapages, the Docker metaframe. In basic terms, Docker is a technology that allows you to create and run virtual computer systems within any other system. This is powerful because in this system, called a container, you can install exactly the software needed to run code, and the same docker container is identical no matter what system it is run on, so your code will always work, no matter where or when you run it. This powerful technology can be leveraged in metaframes with custom docker containers or configurations, allowing you to run virtually any code you can imagine. The applications are endless! To get you started with Docker in metaframes, let\u2019s go through the simple example of creating a word cloud with python.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Getting-Started/your-first-metapage":{"id":"Getting-Started/your-first-metapage","title":"Creating your first metapage","description":"Once you\u2019ve entered the app.metapage.io site and created an account you are now ready to create your first metapage.

They allow you to connect different code components, data sources, and visualization tools into a unified, easily shareable workflow. Each Metapage consists of one or more smaller applications, known as metaframes, which can communicate with each other to enable real-time data exchange and analysis.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}}')}}]);
