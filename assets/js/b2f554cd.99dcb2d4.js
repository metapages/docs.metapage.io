biologically-evolved information systems have overlapping problems and have developed similar solutions.\\n\\n\\nHard-drives wear out, DNA sequences break and accumulate mutations, cosmic rays flib bits, DNA+RNA do not have 100% fidelity on copy, and so on.\\n\\n\\n`some cool pic here: stable diffusions???`\\n\\n\\nThe solution is: `multiple copies`\\n\\n\\nWhile there are greater and lesser solutions at different stages and processes, duplication is the primary and most important mechanism for maintaining information consistency (right word?) over time.\\n\\n\\nCloud data storage maintains multiple copies of the data in different locations so that the loss of a hard-drive unit (which happens at some frequency) is handled (mostly) automatically by software+hardware systems.\\n\\n\\nBiological systems use:\\n\\n- DNA is double-stranded (the spare strand can be used for fixing errors)\\n- multiple copies of chromosomes\\n- Species are populations with multiple copies\\n\\nCultural systems use:\\n\\n- writing\\n- visual art\\n- music and spoken word\\n- places as physical anchors/markers/symbols\\n- others?\\n- digital storage of words, videos, sounds\\n\\nWe think of think of written words as having more durability than spoken word but:\\n\\n- languages evolve over time and reach a point where we cannot read the writing even if in stone (rosetta stone needed for Egyptian hieroglyphs)\\n- written word is archival unless read or spoken\\n- written/carved words can be burnt/destroyed/decayed by time\\n\\nAs long as the words (stories and songs) are spoken and sung in each generation, then the persistence is potentially forever.\\n\\n\\nThus:\\n\\n- deep time cultures must minimize large-scale wars as these cause genocide and thus erasure of deep-time information\\n- shallow-time cultures may not have the larger collective awareness of the long-term consequence of such loss events\\n- parasitic elements of deep time entities

Now I don\u2019t (much): when I build an app or website, that needs some blob storage my thoughts are:\\n\\n1. create a bucket or whatever it\u2019s called in one of some cloud provider, doesn\u2019t have to be the biggest name, they\u2019re all very reliable\\n2. put stuff in\\n3. get stuff out\\n\\nI don\u2019t care where much it is. Why? Because it\u2019s a **solved problem**. Remote blob storage is:\\n\\n- very cheap, and getting cheaper\\n- reliable [1]\\n\\nAt scale however, yes, you do have to think about cost, but those calculations are pretty straightforward business calculations. At anything below very large data, you don\u2019t have to think much about it, and this makes it a **solved problem**.\\n\\n\\nIt\u2019s a solved problem in a similar way that nature has solved storing information: replication, with automated mechanisms for damage repair/reconciliation [2].\\n\\n\\n## Compute is not a solved problem {#7998c587d99540c98564ff6646cb9977}\\n\\n\\nBecause you have to think about it. What I want: \\n\\n\\nI give you some application, some workflow, for example, a machine learning agent, some program I have created, some tool, and it requires from time to time, some level of computing power. You are able to automatically, safely, connect that application to the right level of compute resources as needed.\\n\\n- If the program is in the browser, I might be able to use the GPU, while the tab is open and running.\\n- If the program is downloaded and installed program, I have access to your entire computer, but due to that, security and parasitic programs become a problem.\\n- If I make available some cloud computing, it suddenly becomes complex, with lots of decisions, but with lots of scalable compute resources of different useful types.\\n\\nComputing resources are inherently valuable, and often able to be converted to $$ efficiently via automation.\\n\\n\\nObviously `storage !== compute` but if it were as easy, then I could distribute complex scientific simulations, and revive them years later, and they would \u201cjust work\u201d.\\n\\n\\n## References {#f72739ff70d843c7b655beb4d3c9c218}\\n\\n\\n### [1] **How data is lost in the cloud** {#5ff5b92126b14c0cb53ba25f3a9f00d3}\\n\\n\\n[https://spanning.com/blog/how-data-is-lost-in-the-cloud/](https://spanning.com/blog/how-data-is-lost-in-the-cloud/)\\n\\n\\n### [2] **Mechanisms of ionizing-radiation resistance** {#7d4f1319505a45ddb4c4b1a2e8c47ceb}\\n\\n\\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinococcus_radiodurans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinococcus_radiodurans)"},{"id":"/url-configured-websites","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/url-configured-websites","source":"@site/blog/url-configured-websites.mdx","title":"URL Configured Websites","description":"Use URL hash parameters to store large amounts of user configured data","date":"2023-12-02T02:34:11.670Z","formattedDate":"December 2, 2023","tags":[],"readingTime":2.1,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"URL Configured Websites","sidebar_position":0,"slug":"/url-configured-websites"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Blob storage is a solved problem- what about compute?","permalink":"/blog/blob-storage-is-solved-but-what-about-compute"}},"content":"```mermaid\\nflowchart LR\\n\\tst[\\"cloud data\\"]\\n\\tc[\\"compute\\"]\\n  u[\\"workflows as URLs\\"]\\n  sim[\\"sharable simulations\\"]\\n\\n\\tst --\x3e u\\n\\tc --\x3e u --\x3e sim\\n  click st \\"/blog/blob-storage-is-solved-but-what-about-compute\\"\\n  click u \\"/blog/url-configured-websites\\"\\n  click c \\"https://www.notion.so/metapages/Connect-compute-to-my-tasks-it-s-too-complicated-665f6bbcd4724d5ba3a4b66573473b69?pvs=4\\"\\n```\\n\\n\\n## Use URL hash parameters to store large amounts of user configured data {#4197392d035946949d526637ceb4494e}\\n\\n\\n:::tip\\n\\nIt gives users much more control and creativity over websites\\n\\n:::\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[https://mermaid.live/](https://mermaid.live/) is an excellent example.
