You can share links to your binder instance, so that others can interact with your environment\\n\\n\\nHowever, there is no state management, so every binder instance is it\u2019s own, since the source is the github repo. \\n\\n\\nThere is no searchable catalogue of shared binders, and binders are not composable, they are single stand-alone instances.\\n\\n\\nThe backend is built for kubernetes, which is the largest cluster manager by far, which is good, but you cannot simply plug in your own computer easily. Kubernetes is complex, so you need to have the support of a organization or highly technical individual to implement your own."}]}}')}}]);
