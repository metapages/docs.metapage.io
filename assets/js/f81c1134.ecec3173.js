By recording the past, it allows us to understand the past and therefore the future, preventing deception and allowing culture to grow and develop in deep time.\\n\\n\\nA critical part of the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) is recording and preserving links. When a link to a website dies for whatever reason, but then is preserved, we keep the underlying knowledge, since knowledge is distributed, just like how awareness of the environment is somehow kept in the patterns of neuron connections, not stored someone inside specific neurons.\\n\\n\\n:::note\\n\\nDigital neurons store information patterns in the connections. Biological neurons are more complex, storing information in connections, cellular state, frequency of activation, hormones, among other places. But likely the most important part is the connections between neurons.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n:::note\\n\\nThis is a massive simplification, since there are many examples e.g. snail neurons that store information in the neuronal cells in complex ways [1]\\n\\n:::\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n# Links that store state in the URL help preserve websites through deep time {#4803fc7e4b88415c8143298a44c6f42b}\\n\\n\\n**The more state is stored in the URL directly, the more the website is able to be preserved and also retain functionality.**\\n\\n\\nThis has a number of advantages:\\n\\n- The user state is stored in the URL and is:\\n\\t- user editable (in the future)\\n\\t- machine readable\\n- The origin can be modified dynamically to reroute to domains that are active, without modifying the core state (in the hash parameters of the URL)\\n- Much easier to store, since a URL is just a string\\n\\t- Assuming that the core libraries, assets, and modules are preserved, but that\u2019s a separate concern\\n- More complex applications can be preserved as [metapages](https://docs.metapage.io/docs), therefore allowing someone in the future to access a complex workflow, and use it immediately\\n\\n# References: {#6c6abb081ad445869f6b26cb57d1640c}\\n\\n\\n[1] **Snails reveal how two brain cells can hold the key to decision making**\\n\\n\\n[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160603071655.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160603071655.htm)"},{"id":"/url-configured-websites","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/url-configured-websites","source":"@site/blog/url-configured-websites.mdx","title":"URL Configured Websites","description":"URLs can safely and effectively store user created code or configuration (even credentials [1]) (access to things).

Now I don\u2019t (much): when I build an app or website, that needs some blob storage my thoughts are:\\n\\n1. create a bucket or whatever it\u2019s called in one of some cloud provider, doesn\u2019t have to be the biggest name, they\u2019re all very reliable\\n2. put stuff in\\n3. get stuff out\\n\\nI don\u2019t care where much it is. Why? Because it\u2019s a **solved problem**. Remote blob storage is:\\n\\n- very cheap, and getting cheaper\\n- reliable [1]\\n\\nAt scale however, yes, you do have to think about cost, but those calculations are pretty straightforward business calculations. At anything below very large data, you don\u2019t have to think much about it, and this makes it a **solved problem**.\\n\\n\\nIt\u2019s a solved problem in a similar way that nature has solved storing information: replication, with automated mechanisms for damage repair/reconciliation [2].\\n\\n\\n## Compute is not a solved problem {#7998c587d99540c98564ff6646cb9977}\\n\\n\\nBecause you have to think about it. What I want: \\n\\n\\nI give you some application, some workflow, for example, a machine learning agent, some program I have created, some tool, and it requires from time to time, some level of computing power. You are able to automatically, safely, connect that application to the right level of compute resources as needed.\\n\\n- If the program is in the browser, I might be able to use the GPU, while the tab is open and running.\\n- If the program is downloaded and installed program, I have access to your entire computer, but due to that, security and parasitic programs become a problem.\\n- If I make available some cloud computing, it suddenly becomes complex, with lots of decisions, but with lots of scalable compute resources of different useful types.\\n\\nComputing resources are inherently valuable, and often able to be converted to $$ efficiently via automation.\\n\\n\\nObviously `storage !== compute` but if it were as easy, then I could distribute complex scientific simulations, and revive them years later, and they would \u201cjust work\u201d.\\n\\n\\nThe team at [https://metapage.io](https://metapage.io/) aim to solve that problem: compute as a simple commodity.\\n\\n\\nWhen we can treat compute as a commodity, we have more power over the compute providers. When they manage to get their system to be difficult to move from, you lose bargaining power.\\n\\n\\nPersonally, I default to [https://www.digitalocean.com/](https://www.digitalocean.com/). This isn\u2019t a paid plug! They just do a great job of making plenty of options, at the right complexity/resolution, not too many, not too few.\\n\\n\\nFor my full stacks, I\u2019m using AWS but not directly: my choice of platform vendor ([https://nhost.io](https://nhost.io/)) makes that decision for me.\\n\\n\\n# References {#f72739ff70d843c7b655beb4d3c9c218}\\n\\n\\n### [1] **How data is lost in the cloud** {#5ff5b92126b14c0cb53ba25f3a9f00d3}\\n\\n\\n[https://spanning.com/blog/how-data-is-lost-in-the-cloud/](https://spanning.com/blog/how-data-is-lost-in-the-cloud/)\\n\\n\\n### [2] **Mechanisms of ionizing-radiation resistance** {#7d4f1319505a45ddb4c4b1a2e8c47ceb}\\n\\n\\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinococcus_radiodurans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinococcus_radiodurans)\\n\\n\\n```mermaid\\ngraph LR\\n  a[\\"Storage \u2705 but compute \ud83d\uded1\\"] \\n  b[\\"FAIR but for compute\\"]\\n  a --\x3e b\\n  click a \\"/blog/blob-storage-is-solved-but-what-about-compute\\"\\n  style a fill:#fff,stroke:#999999,stroke-width:2px,color:#000\\n  click b \\"/blog/fair-data-what-about-compute\\"\\n```"},{"id":"/mesh","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/mesh","source":"@site/blog/mesh.mdx","title":"MESH (Molecular Evaluation Science Hub)","description":"[jump to examples]","date":"2025-07-24T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Dion Whitehead","title":"Creator of Metapages","url":"https://github.com/metapages","email":"hey@metapage.io","socials":{"github":"https://github.com/dionjwa"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/dionjwa.png","key":"dion","page":null},{"name":"Karl Lundquist","title":"Metapages Contributor","url":"https://klundquist.github.io/portfolio/","socials":{"github":"https://github.com/klundquist"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/klundquist.png","key":"karl","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"MESH (Molecular Evaluation Science Hub)","sidebar_position":0,"slug":"/mesh","date":"2025-07-24T00:00:00.000Z","authors":["dion","karl"],"hide_table_of_contents":true},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Blob storage is a solved problem- what about compute?","permalink":"/blog/blob-storage-is-solved-but-what-about-compute"},"nextItem":{"title":"Organization Lifespan","permalink":"/blog/organization-lifespan"}},"content":"[[jump to examples](/blog/mesh#23a018579bb580928271f4e8f87d97bd)]\\n\\n\\nEvery week on Linkedin and other social media there is a new exciting generative model or molecular simulation or binding prediction tool released ([click here to see just my stream](https://metapages.notion.site/LinkedIn-Stream-of-AI-Biotech-Molecular-Modeling-232018579bb580838900d1cd65b4655e)).

[Bits to Binders](https://www.biomlsociety.org/challenge) was another one of these kinds new challenges/competitions, and I threw my hat in the ring!\\n\\n\\n![](./mesh.23101857-9bb5-8022-91b2-d766ea04ce62.png)\\n\\n\\nMyself and 4 others  joined this challenge to form a team that would generate a protein binder to a specific immune cell receptor, where a binder that would bind _just right_ (not too much, not too little) would have the potential to treat some specific cancers.\\n\\n\\nOur team had access to GPU resources, the target, and a brand new generative AI model for protein design: [RFDiffusion](https://www.bakerlab.org/2023/07/11/diffusion-model-for-protein-design/). None of us previously knew each other, and all come with different backgrounds and experience and technology\\n\\n\\nHowever, despite our enthusiasm, our team, and many like ours, encountered significant struggles. Internally within group, we struggled to effectively share workflows and results. The organizers of the competition had done a great job to gather sponsors and organizations who collectively provided a significant number of valuable GPU resources. \\n\\n\\nWe could only utilize a very tiny fraction of available GPUs due to both mundane and complex technical and logistical challenges. There was simply a lack of infrastructure to support this social-technical phenomenon. We wanted a vibrant community, and the organizers did an absolutely fantastic job, but the outcome of the competition specifically in respect to sharing the methodologies was hampered by a lack of suitable infrastructure. \\n\\n\\nPut simply, there is no universal, straightforward way to share a computational workflow that requires visualization and interactivity (due to molecular structures) also connected to GPUs running AI models and simulations, running seamlessly on whatever GPU resources are available to you. While workflow systems like Nextflow and others can be a piece of the puzzle, they lack specific features around sharing and publishing due to the inherent technical tradeoffs.\\n\\n\\nThis missing connection means that innovation remained isolated in the groups and labs of origin, regardless of the desire to share them. \\n\\n\\n## What about the competition leaderboard examples you posted {#23a018579bb580c2a6c2d2d8b3b72350}\\n\\n\\nThe [Adaptyv Bio](https://foundry.adaptyvbio.com/competition) competition website looks fantastic, significant work and thought went into the design and infrastructure:\\n\\n\\n![](./mesh.23a01857-9bb5-80d7-9625-d695eb075957.png)\\n\\n\\n\\n<div className=\\"custom-docunotion-row\\">\\n  <div className=\\"custom-docunotion-row-cell\\">\\n\\nBut digging into the well-designed pages and you find that the actual design process are not embedded, and often not available:\\n  </div>\\n  <div className=\\"custom-docunotion-row-cell\\">\\n\\n\\n![](./mesh.23a01857-9bb5-8010-b9ce-f174c74ba82e.png)\\n\\n  </div>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd that is part of the problem. Though well-designed, the competition site is a bespoke presentation, often not containing the methods, and results that are difficult to incorporate or evaluate systematically, and in the example above, there are no methods for you to copy and test yourself.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\nFor the [ASAP Discovery](https://polarishub.io/competitions/asap-discovery/antiviral-drug-discovery-2025#competiton-results) competition, for _some_ entries there is code, but the `</> code` link is simply to a github repository. That means a lot of custom, bespoke work to understand, and possibly use those methods:\\n\\n\\n![](./mesh.23a01857-9bb5-806a-8bf4-ec8cf2c8cffc.png)\\n\\n\\nSo in summary: you often cannot get methods and tools, and if you can the code is in a form that requires significant work just to run yourself. It\u2019s too slow and limited, and this limits our ability to share and learn from each other, and it wastes a lot of repeated work, as everyone who wants to use a given tool has to do the same work (wasting significant effort) getting it working.\\n\\n\\n## MESH (Molecular Evaluation Science Hub) {#231018579bb58024b701eb2117104dc9}\\n\\n\\nRecognizing these limitations, we propose a _socio-technical_ initiative: MESH. Using some recent breakthroughs in [publishing scientific workflows](https://metapage.io/), we aim to harness the very best aspects of human collaboration: shared innovation and collective learning, and in this particular space, via leaderboards of workflows. These workflows are run and expressed in the browser, even if they are only headless workflows. The workflows can be shared, modified, and run entirely in the browser, even though there are backend containers running on some grid or cluster.\\n\\n\\nA central part of our vision is developing the collective set of open-source tools that express workflows directly in the browser: [metapage workflows](https://docs.metapage.io/), combined with existing proven social structures for efficient idea exploration and refinement: public competitions and leaderboards that can rapidly and efficiently evaluate and spread to target communities novel and powerful molecular dynamics software tools, in a form they can immediately use.\\n\\n\\nThe [metapages](https://metapage.io/) platform and tools allow researchers to easily create persistent, durable, yet flexible leaderboards. These leaderboards aren\'t just static records; they are dynamic, adaptable workflows that researchers can easily manipulate, extend, and incorporate into their own workflows, in whole or in by parts. By leveraging a public compute grid, researchers can effortlessly connect their own or others computational resources, whether their own laptop, HPC clusters, or turn-key cloud solutions. This makes shared workflows independent of where they run (as long as you have or we provide the necessary compute resources), thus enhancing accessibility and reducing the barriers to participation and collaboration.\\n\\n\\n### Example workflow in the browser {#233018579bb580d49e8be47c60d06c01}\\n\\n\\nHere is an example that was quickly put together to test a tool, shared among the team, that we can share with the entire world simply via a url or embedding anwhere where URLs can be: [https://metapage.io/m/71990da894774ebca5a4ad2895201a5c](https://metapage.io/m/71990da894774ebca5a4ad2895201a5c)\\n\\n\\n![](./mesh.23301857-9bb5-8043-8b62-ef6e2621cbaf.png)\\n\\n\\nThe outputs of this workflow tool can be connected to other workflows, and copied with a single click, replicating all the code and data.\\n\\n\\nThis initiative is in the house of [The Open Molecular Software Foundation](https://omsf.io/) whose [mission statement](https://omsf.io/about/mission/) is a succinct superset of ours. Our particular alignment is especially about accelerating progress. We envision empowering researchers of all technical backgrounds to seamlessly integrate innovations in molecular dynamics AI models developed by one group into the workflows of another, and they will be able to do this because they will be able to rely on tools that are more reliable, as the tools will have been (and can continue to be evaluated by a community. This democratization of AI tools and knowledge will unlock previously constrained collaboration potential, fueling advancements and discoveries across the molecular biology and broader scientific community.\\n\\n\\nWe will follow up with a post about the technical differences between metapage workflows and other comparable stacks such as Jupyter Notebooks and workflow systems such as Nextflow.\\n\\n\\n## Examples {#23a018579bb580928271f4e8f87d97bd}\\n\\n- open source, all source code embedded in the workflow\\n- copyable with a single click (when logged in)\\n- computation containers just work, no installation needed, just runs in the browser\\n\\n| [example leaderboard framework](https://metapage.io/m/ab7a2dc814fa46fabb2aafac75061583)   |\\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\n| [protein-ligand docking workflow](https://metapage.io/m/71990da894774ebca5a4ad2895201a5c) |\\n\\n\\n**References**\\n\\n\\nCompetition with dashboard\\n\\n\\n[https://foundry.adaptyvbio.com/competition](https://foundry.adaptyvbio.com/competition)\\n\\n\\n[https://beta.adaptyvbio.com/benchbb](https://beta.adaptyvbio.com/benchbb)\\n\\n\\n[https://polarishub.io/blog/antiviral-competition](https://polarishub.io/blog/antiviral-competition)\\n\\n\\n[https://paperswithcode.com/method/clip](https://paperswithcode.com/method/clip)"},{"id":"/organization-lifespan","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/organization-lifespan","source":"@site/blog/organization-lifespan.mdx","title":"Organization Lifespan","description":"We have a plan for the lifecycle of the organization.","date":"2025-07-02T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Dion Whitehead","title":"Creator of Metapages","url":"https://github.com/metapages","email":"hey@metapage.io","socials":{"github":"https://github.com/dionjwa"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/dionjwa.png","key":"dion","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Organization Lifespan","sidebar_position":31,"slug":"/organization-lifespan","date":"2025-07-02T00:00:00.000Z","authors":["dion"],"hide_table_of_contents":true},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"MESH (Molecular Evaluation Science Hub)","permalink":"/blog/mesh"},"nextItem":{"title":"10 minutes to integrate a brand new bio AI model","permalink":"/blog/model-bioemu"}},"content":"We have a plan for the lifecycle of the organization.\\n\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n\\n## We aim for a worker owned business entity {#1a8018579bb580469fb6e7fd6f854628}\\n\\n\\nFor scientific data, long-term durability requires a model where the investor class is not the primary holder of power within the organization, as there is a rich history of investors buying companies dealing with scientific data, and maximizing profit at all costs.

There are a number of platforms that \\n\\n1. Take a jupyter notebook\\n2. Run it, get the outputs\\n3. Convert the notebook and outputs into a static web page\\n\\nFor example, [jupyterbook](https://next.jupyterbook.org/) (using the [myst-nb](https://myst-nb.readthedocs.io/) extension) compiles a jupyter notebook, with text and images, into a page for publishing. If you want to run the notebook yourself, you might be able to via [binder](https://mybinder.org/) or [jupyterhub](https://jupyter.org/hub).\\n\\n\\nSo, it looks like this is a solved problem? Actually, there are many limitations with these kinds of solutions, and they stem from starting with something not built for the web, and bolting on pieces to make it web-friendly. It works, but it ends up being complicated, and starts to show limitations.\\n\\n\\n# Problems and limitations {#1ab018579bb5801896ccd45461686ebc}\\n\\n\\n## Problem: the content is static {#1ab018579bb580bbb52ee2d022207cee}\\n\\n\\nThe above platforms generate the content for a fixed, static website. There are some options to run the notebook on [binder](https://mybinder.org/) or [jupyterhub](https://jupyter.org/hub), but those platforms are ephemeral, and greatly limit the kind of compute instances the notebooks run on. Any data generated is lost unless specific ad-hoc steps are taken to keep generated outputs. What if I didn\u2019t want to run the notebook on those platforms, for lots of reasons (not enough compute, storage, persistence, security), then I don\u2019t have other options.\\n\\n\\nWhile some notebook visualizations are dynamic in some sense, as you can interact with e.g. javascript plots, it becomes complicated or limited if you want to perform computation in the final published notebook.\\n\\n\\n## Limitation: you cannot easily take all or a part of the notebook for your own workflows {#1ab018579bb580089277eaab89f9f7d3}\\n\\n\\nJupyter notebooks run on a single kernel, with all the visualization libraries built into the monolith kernel. \\n\\n\\nIf I wanted to swap out one visualization library for another (e.g. matplotlib for plotly.js) it\u2019s quite a bit of coding. \\n\\n\\nThere\u2019s no ability for users to publish components, and re-use those components in different notebooks. Each notebook is a monolith, unless you publish a separate library, which comes with it\u2019s own friction and cost.\\n\\n\\nYou don\u2019t just publish and share code and visualization snippets for others. Instead, you have to manually copy and paste and finagle any code from one notebook to another. And everyone has this same barrier. \\n\\n\\nThere is considerable friction in sharing and re-using notebooks and parts of notebooks.\\n\\n\\n## Limitation: a single kernel, not always containerized {#1ab018579bb5804eb280ef88019b4d12}\\n\\n\\nJupyter notebooks define their kernels, but without much automation to build those kernels. Take a look at [this example of a recent published model for predicting structure distributions of a protein](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pablo-arantes/making-it-rain/blob/main/BioEmu.ipynb#scrollTo=Fk9bZi5MiD8h): each step requires the user input, and data is stored in Google Drive only. Interaction is via the notebook interface, so integrating the code into your own workflow is a manual process that every single person must repeat, if they want to use the model in their own workflows. \\n\\n\\nI would like to not have to ever manually install anything. Workflows should contain all instructions for how to build their required computation environments, and those instructions should be automated by default.\\n\\n\\n## Limitation: you cannot easily collaborate real time  {#1ab018579bb5803dbbefd761cabc34ea}\\n\\n\\nThe platforms for sharing notebooks are meant as publishing as a final step. Making it easier to publish is a good thing, but publishing is really only a step in a sequence: you might want to publish so that others might be able to use your work. This process might go back and forth, but since publishing is treated as a final step, the collaborative aspect, which is often the bulk of the work, is neglected. The final published product is not easily integrated into others workflows without significant human labour. \\n\\n\\nPutting a notebook in a git repository is helpful, but not sufficient.\\n\\n\\n## Problem: the complexity of the layers introduces more places for bugs and failures {#1ab018579bb58007abd7de693c0ee709}\\n\\n\\n\\n<div className=\\"custom-docunotion-row\\">\\n  <div className=\\"custom-docunotion-row-cell\\">\\n\\nBecause the notebooks may not be properly containerized, it\u2019s more likely to get build errors. The public platforms to host jupyter notebooks are by necessity limited, and it\u2019s some work to run them yourself, so the surface area for bugs and incompatibilities is large.\\n\\n<br/>\\n  </div>\\n  <div className=\\"custom-docunotion-row-cell\\">\\n\\n\\n![](./a-new-way-to-publish.1ab01857-9bb5-80fb-b4bf-f58e086545e3.png)\\n\\n  </div>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Where to publish your code/data/visualization? {#1a7018579bb580fda0d0f3b85369e4e4}\\n\\n\\nSo that other researchers can actually use them? Publishing your work doesn\u2019t automatically mean it can be found. There is no one place to search for code and data and workflows, so finding code snippets or visualization relevant for your problems is ad-hoc and a manual process.\\n\\n\\n# Metapages: publish and embed complete scientific workflows, when you want, where you want, how you want {#1ab018579bb5800bb8d4cf75d38f8b9d}\\n\\n\\nMetapages are web-first scientific workflows. \\n\\n\\n## Publish in two clicks {#1ab018579bb580cc83c9c45761effee1}\\n\\n\\nYou don\u2019t need a complicated separate build/process/embed publish step required of e.g. [jupyterbook](https://next.jupyterbook.org/).

So a jupyter notebook consists of \u201ccells\u201d which are code blocks executing in the same \u201ckernel\u201d (computer process). \\n\\n\\nMetapage components, called meta_frames,_ are also websites. The parent page uses an [open-source module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@metapages/metapage) to connect the frames via data pipes.

A docker container can be represented as a URL, where the URL contains everything needed to defined a docker image, build the docker image, and run the container.\\n\\n\\nThis way, components (jupyter\u2019s cells) are completely independent of each other, and thus can be published independently, and immediately found and used by your audience.\\n\\n\\nThey are a new way of doing data science, and we hope they will foster a new age of sharing, communication and collaboration, by removing the drudgery and making sharing code, data, and compute happen at the speed of thought.\\n\\n\\n### Sharing {#1a2018579bb58042899df256b4f54689}\\n\\n\\nSharing code and data is the lifeblood of (data) science. Jupyter notebooks do not address this need directly, instead, you can kindof share code by publishing the notebook in a fixed repository like github. \\n\\n\\nAnd there it becomes a static artifact. You cannot share back and forth easily, or share only parts, or share data with the notebook where the data is modified. \\n\\n\\nMetapages are web-first, shareable with a single click, and not only the pages, but the components also can be independently shared and published. You can then embed \\n\\n\\n|               | Jupyter Notebooks                                                                                                                                     | Metapages                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\\n| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\n| Languages     | Many, but only a single kernel per notebook                                                                                                           | Any, each cell can potentially have their own container                                                                                                                                                                 |\\n| Sharing       | Limited to once                                                                                                                                       | Immediate with one click, real-time, customizable                                                                                                                                                                       |\\n| Data          | Usually has to be mounted in from some defined remote storage, vendor lock-in limits data sharing, too many solutions prevent ease of sharing         | All metapages come with a scoped file system, also can consume any cloud storage.
