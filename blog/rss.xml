<p>For scientific data, long-term durability requires a model where the investor class is not the primary holder of power within the organization, as there is a rich history of investors buying companies dealing with scientific data, and maximizing profit at all costs. Profitability is required, but if the main driving force, then the organization lifecycle is a shorter lifespan.</p>

<p>Our public stated plan in this eventuality:</p>

<li>All currently non-open assets and code will be open-sourced</li>
<li>All public pages and components will be available at the same URL address, but immutable (if not already)</li>
<li>We will transition the stewardship of the organization to a volunteer organization or under an umbrella foundation, with input from the community</li>
</ul>
<p>Our promise: regardless of what happens to the metapages organization, your workflows will still be able to run, far into the future.</p>
<p>We welcome community input in the process, in this eventuality.</p>

<p>It took me 10 minutes to create the docker image, get the installation working, and add a molecule viewer. I published it with one click, and now it’s available to everyone to add to their own workflows with a few clicks.</p>
<p>Metapages allows the sharing of containerized components that are then connectable to your workflows, so you can prototype at the speed of thought.</p>

<p>Jupyter notebooks have become the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07196-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">de-facto standard for data scientists</a>. They combine code, data, and visualization, and can be shared via e.g. github. Many companies, such as <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/notebook-innovation-591ee3221233" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/scaling-knowledge-at-airbnb-875d73eff091" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Airbnb</a>, <a href="https://wiki.latch.bio/pods/getting-started#3-access-rstudio-and-jupyter-labs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Latchbio</a>, use jupyter notebooks successfully to manage their complex data needs.</p>

If you want to run someone else’s notebook, you have to use a specialized service with limitations and problems with data, or you need to manually install libraries, or run a docker container, and again, where to store the data outputs is left to you</li>
</ul>
<p>Jupyter notebooks grew from solving a particular set of problems, and its growth is constrained by those technical origins.</p>
<p>Notebooks are tightly coupled systems: it’s all or nothing.</p>

<p>Imagine if you could</p>
<ul>
<li>write code in any language</li>
<li>combine it seamlessly with browser interactive visualization (without complicated bridging code)</li>
<li>share and publish <em>instantly</em> with your team or audience, and know that they will be able to instantly re-run the computation, if needed, without installation</li>
<li>re-use any component that will reliable connect to your own workflow without complicated and time-consuming finessing</li>
<li>run on any computer or cluster, and never have to perform complicated setups when running other workflows</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the <a href="https://metapage.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">metapage platform</a>:</p>
<div class="custom-docunotion-row"><div class="custom-docunotion-row-cell"><p></p><p><a href="https://metapage.io/dion/Python-interactive-plotting-87ae11673508447e883b598bf7da9c5d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.metapage.io/assets/images/compare-to-jupyter-notebooks.1a201857-9bb5-8023-9b70-e5b3b8f98b60-8b9054702c7e9b659f67d698d8cf9e54.png" width="2528" height="1250" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><p></p></div><div class="custom-docunotion-row-cell"><p>In the example workflow, you have python code generating a plotly diagram. Unlike a jupyter notebook, you can simply copy this immediately and start modifying code. There is no complex setup, and you can published in a single click.</p></div></div>
<p><strong>Metapages</strong> are web-first workflows. They consist of components, that are <em>also</em> webpages. So a jupyter notebook consists of “cells” which are code blocks executing in the same “kernel” (computer process).</p>
<p>Metapage components, called meta_frames,_ are also websites. The parent page uses an <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@metapages/metapage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open-source module</a> to connect the frames via data pipes. Since the components are webpages, they can be anything.</p>
<p>For example, one component runs docker containers. A docker container can be represented as a URL, where the URL contains everything needed to defined a docker image, build the docker image, and run the container.</p>
<p>This way, components (jupyter’s cells) are completely independent of each other, and thus can be published independently, and immediately found and used by your audience.</p>
<p>They are a new way of doing data science, and we hope they will foster a new age of sharing, communication and collaboration, by removing the drudgery and making sharing code, data, and compute happen at the speed of thought.</p>

<p>Sharing code and data is the lifeblood of (data) science. Jupyter notebooks do not address this need directly, instead, you can kindof share code by publishing the notebook in a fixed repository like github.</p>
<p>And there it becomes a static artifact. You cannot share back and forth easily, or share only parts, or share data with the notebook where the data is modified.</p>
<p>Metapages are web-first, shareable with a single click, and not only the pages, but the components also can be independently shared and published. You can then embed</p>

<p>No. Metapages are closer to applications, or workflows, but they are not notebooks.</p>
<p><strong>Metapages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>are not linear (although they can be)</li>
<li>are not built to present lots of text with some visualization, rather the opposite: visualization first, text optional</li>
<li>are easily embeddable, and able to embed other tools</li>
<li>currently have less integration with tools like debuggers</li>
</ul>
<p>There will always be times when a notebook interface is more appropriate.</p>

<p>Here is a very basic simple example of what you would also do in a jupyter notebook (run some code and visualize). Unlike a notebook, it runs in the browser without needing to spin up a specific compute instance, and (unlike a jupyter notebook) you can immediately copy, edit, share.</p>

<p>The goal of the <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAIR principles</a> is to</p>
<blockquote>
<p>improve the <strong>F</strong>indability, <strong>A</strong>ccessibility, <strong>I</strong>nteroperability, and <strong>R</strong>euse of digital assets.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The principles emphasise machine-actionability (i.e., the capacity of computational systems to find, access, interoperate, and reuse data with none or minimal human intervention) because humans increasingly rely on computational support to deal with data as a result of the increase in volume, complexity, and creation speed of data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the goals of the metapage platform is to make scientific workflows instantly findable, editable, and shareable.</p>
<p>Metapages are well-positioned, as they are machine readable, using JSON to describe their inputs, outputs, metadata, and often the code is directly readable.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The POSI principles</a> are a set of goals to promote open scholarly infrastructure that guide the heart and direction of the metapage platform. Some aspects specific to our organization:</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="193018579bb580469aedc90c74f46268"><strong>Governance: the metapage platform will seek to be a worker owned enterprise:</strong><a href="https://docs.metapage.io/blog/posi-principles#193018579bb580469aedc90c74f46268" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 193018579bb580469aedc90c74f46268" title="Direct link to 193018579bb580469aedc90c74f46268">​</a></h3>
<p>We aim to have transparent governance, with input and visibility from our users. The goal is to eventually convert the current LLC into a worker owned cooperative, or similar structure. A cooperative structure has the best chance of long-term survival and durability, which is one of our core values: users workflows will <em>always</em> run.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="193018579bb58016884bc00ca48bcc22">Sustainability: the metapage organization aims for financial growth<a href="https://docs.metapage.io/blog/posi-principles#193018579bb58016884bc00ca48bcc22" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Sustainability: the metapage organization aims for financial growth" title="Direct link to Sustainability: the metapage organization aims for financial growth">​</a></h3>
<p>Based on services, not data or compute.</p>
<p>We specifically store data at cost, and provide computation resources, also at cost. We aim to make compute resources a commodity, so will never charge a computation “value add” beyond what it takes us to service scalable cloud infrastructure.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="193018579bb58038baade8dae8f4d2fe">Insurance: metapage resources (workflows) will always run, even if the organization is wound down<a href="https://docs.metapage.io/blog/posi-principles#193018579bb58038baade8dae8f4d2fe" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Insurance: metapage resources (workflows) will always run, even if the organization is wound down" title="Direct link to Insurance: metapage resources (workflows) will always run, even if the organization is wound down">​</a></h3>
<p>We will save user data as long as there are resources, and will enable users to take their workflows with them, in their entirety, and run them simply with a public, open-source, static browser (that users can also take and fork).</p>

<p>Metapage workflows require three things to run:</p>
<ol>
<li>A website serving the <a href="https://github.com/metapages/archive.metapage.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">standalone metapage app</a></li>
<li>A website serving the <a href="https://container.mtfm.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">metaframe container client</a></li>
<li>A <a href="https://github.com/metapages/compute-queues/releases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">metaframe container worker agent</a> running locally connecting to 2.</li>
</ol>
<p>Currently 1. is the main <a href="http://metapage.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">metapage.io</a> app. If the organization is no longer functional, we will wind down and convert the domain metapage.io into the standalone app <a href="https://github.com/metapages/archive.metapage.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open-sourced here</a>.</p>
<p>You will be able to simply paste your workflows, or include the link to the definition in the URL, and the definition will be loaded.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="195018579bb58097bdadcc2bd6afa2d2">Immutable archived metapages are already a reality<a href="https://docs.metapage.io/blog/workflows-forever#195018579bb58097bdadcc2bd6afa2d2" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Immutable archived metapages are already a reality" title="Direct link to Immutable archived metapages are already a reality">​</a></h2>
<p>When a metapage is published, we store it in an immutable database that we will be available for the long term. We aim to make this archive part of a public record, with a commitment to make the public resources always searchable and available.</p>
<p>This is an ongoing effort. Contributions and ideas welcome.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s one thing to have access to data, but it’s another thing to have code <em>and also</em> a reliable, reproducible way to run the code that operates on the data. In other words, it’s not enough to just serve data, we also need principles around HOW we create compute environments that process the data.</p>
<!-- -->
<p>Data often doesn’t live on it’s own, it often requires extra tooling. For example, The Protein Data Bank <a href="https://www.rcsb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.rcsb.org/</a>: it serves various protein structures and complexes, but also has multiple ways to display and interact with the 3D structures:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.metapage.io/assets/images/fair-data-what-about-compute.19301857-9bb5-806f-bdf2-e7f51bf8b2c1-825f61188237a5872f9ae58c4da2d5dd.png" width="469" height="341" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Simply having a database serving files is not enough. Researchers need tools integrated with with data to be able to view, summarize, search, etc.</p>
<h1>Towards principles for FAIR-aligned computation</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAIR principles</a> are mostly about data, and accessing data. What’s missing is computation, or specifically, how the data is processed.</p>
<p>Ideally given some definition, a user can automatically reproduce and use a compute environment and run some code in that environment, operating on (FAIR 😀) data.</p>
<p>Since this is compute not data, the principles are overlapping, yet different:</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="193018579bb58033b274fc6868f09851"><strong>Findable</strong><a href="https://docs.metapage.io/blog/fair-data-what-about-compute#193018579bb58033b274fc6868f09851" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 193018579bb58033b274fc6868f09851" title="Direct link to 193018579bb58033b274fc6868f09851">​</a></h3>
<p>This property is not as important as for data, because compute environments are inherently ephemeral. The underlying libraries and code to build the environments must be accessible.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="193018579bb5806d8b11ecbac488a97b"><strong>Accessible</strong><a href="https://docs.metapage.io/blog/fair-data-what-about-compute#193018579bb5806d8b11ecbac488a97b" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 193018579bb5806d8b11ecbac488a97b" title="Direct link to 193018579bb5806d8b11ecbac488a97b">​</a></h3>
<p>Code and tools to build and run the compute environments must be accessible.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A1</strong> The metadata describing how to build the environment must suffice for the majority of tools and systems used to run the environments.</li>
<li><strong>A2</strong> The tools used to build the environment must be <strong>open, free, and universally implementable</strong> (e.g., Git, DockerHub, OCI registries).</li>
<li><strong>A3.</strong> <strong>Metadata remains accessible</strong> even if the code or environment is deprecated, providing references to alternative implementations or archived versions.</li>
<li><strong>A4.</strong> Where possible, compute environments are not prohibitive in resources to build unless specifically requirements dictate that necessity.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="193018579bb580d78c45f459b7311267"><strong>Interoperable</strong><a href="https://docs.metapage.io/blog/fair-data-what-about-compute#193018579bb580d78c45f459b7311267" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 193018579bb580d78c45f459b7311267" title="Direct link to 193018579bb580d78c45f459b7311267">​</a></h3>
<p>Code and compute environments should work across platforms and integrate seamlessly into workflows.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I1.</strong> The compute environments described should be machine readable, and convertible into compatible platforms (e.g. <a href="https://podman-desktop.io/docs/migrating-from-docker/managing-docker-compatibility" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">docker and podman</a>)</li>
<li><strong>I2.</strong> Code running in an environment build by one platform should run the same as an environment built with a different platform.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="193018579bb5807cb410fa8a20dddd2c"><strong>Reusable</strong><a href="https://docs.metapage.io/blog/fair-data-what-about-compute#193018579bb5807cb410fa8a20dddd2c" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 193018579bb5807cb410fa8a20dddd2c" title="Direct link to 193018579bb5807cb410fa8a20dddd2c">​</a></h3>
<p>Code and compute environments should be designed to be replicable and adaptable for future research.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>R1.</strong> A compute environment running some code can be used for running different, but compatible code. Where possible, environments can be re-used for efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<h1>The metapage platform solution</h1>
<p>The metapage organization and platform <a href="https://docs.metapage.io/blog/fair-principles">is guided by FAIR principles</a>, and we have developed an open source platform and API for representing docker containers and code as URLs:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.metapage.io/assets/images/fair-data-what-about-compute.19301857-9bb5-80ec-9915-f915048ca263-ed97a3cf94bffedf7143cad05849420d.png" width="1233" height="372" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.metapage.io/blog/url-configured-websites">We like URLs encoding state here!</a></p>
<p>The URL encodes the full definition of:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>Dockerfile</code>, or docker image</li>
<li>Optionally a git repository for building the docker image</li>
<li>Optionally scripts to mount into the container at runtime</li>
</ul>
<p>We provide a worker agent the user runs on their own computer or cluster or workstation. The worker takes the docker image definition, and builds the image, then runs the code+data in the container environment. This browser client is actually a component, and can be connected to other browser components to exchange data.</p>
<p>For a complete example showing a docker container running a ML workflow and producing visual output: <a href="https://metapage.io/dion/Python-ML-Workflow-385b95ab9cb04fa7a76df627b2bde668" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://metapage.io/dion/Python-ML-Workflow-385b95ab9cb04fa7a76df627b2bde668</a></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="194018579bb580be8653efea408daf81">User experience<a href="https://docs.metapage.io/blog/fair-data-what-about-compute#194018579bb580be8653efea408daf81" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to User experience" title="Direct link to User experience">​</a></h2>
<p>As long as there is compute resources attached, users then do not have to manually install anything, or worry about their host system: the definition defined in the URL contains everything needed to reproduce the compute environment, and connectable from the browser.</p>
<p>Users can then take existing compute environments, complete with code, and directly modify, copy, and share these environments, directly as you would any other URL, or via our <a href="https://metapage.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">index of components</a></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="194018579bb5806aae41ee7529a1f9cf">How it works<a href="https://docs.metapage.io/blog/fair-data-what-about-compute#194018579bb5806aae41ee7529a1f9cf" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How it works" title="Direct link to How it works">​</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.metapage.io/docs/containers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See here for detailed instructions</a></p>
<p>We provide an open and open-source compute queue API layer, where any user can create their own secure queue, connect their computer, and run docker containers and code all defined in a single URL.</p>
<p>The URL contains the <code>Dockerfile</code>  definition, or a publicly accessible docker image, optionally code, optionally a github repository to build from.</p>
<p>This way, the mechanism to build a reproducible compute environment is simply a URL, where users simply add their own commodity compute resources (their laptop, workstation, cluster, almost anything that can run docker containers).</p>
<p>If the user wanted to run their own complete system that is different, they can, because the definition of the compute environment is encoded into the URL, thus available for all.</p>

<!-- -->
<p>Data retention / expiration is often something thought about only when needed (which makes sense!). But if you decide ahead of time when and what data expires, your entire data lifecycle now has clear boundaries.</p>
<p>This is not yet implemented, it’s our first draft of a multiple-lifespans policy, so this is a starting point for a conversation.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Data object</th><th>Expiration</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Metapage definitions</td><td>Active account: never</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Inactive account: 10 years unless otherwise by law</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Published: never</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Public but not published: 100 years</td></tr><tr><td>Metapage definition backups</td><td>Time machine schedule</td></tr><tr><td>Metapage states</td><td>Time machine schedule</td></tr><tr><td>Metapage files</td><td>Active account: never</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Inactive account: tbd, depends on size</td></tr></tbody></table>
<h1>Permanence: what does it mean</h1>
<p>To keep metapages past the 100 year mark, then simply share them.</p>
<p>The 100 year span starts then anew.</p>
<h1>Time machine schedule</h1>
<ul>
<li>All within the last minute</li>
<li>Last hour: one per minute</li>
<li>Last 24 hours: one per hour</li>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>BinderHub is a kubernetes-based cloud service that allows users to share reproducible interactive computing environments from code repositories.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Binder is a way to create reproducible interactive single compute environments, that serve Jupyter notebooks. You can share links to your binder instance, so that others can interact with your environment</p>
<p>However, there is no state management, so every binder instance is it’s own, since the source is the github repo.</p>
<p>There is no searchable catalogue of shared binders, and binders are not composable, they are single stand-alone instances.</p>
<p>The backend is built for kubernetes, which is the largest cluster manager by far, which is good, but you cannot simply plug in your own computer easily. Kubernetes is complex, so you need to have the support of a organization or highly technical individual to implement your own.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cheap and simple data blob storage is widely available and relatively easy to access and use. However, easily applying the right kind of compute is still laborious with too many complex barriers, arcane commands, hard to understand costs, and psychological anxiety that interrupts flow state when prototyping, analyzing, and generally doing data intensive research and engineering.</p>
<!-- -->
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="391abf3711fb4cdc989cd95a352c95d3">Storage is a solved problem<a href="https://docs.metapage.io/blog/blob-storage-is-solved-but-what-about-compute#391abf3711fb4cdc989cd95a352c95d3" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Storage is a solved problem" title="Direct link to Storage is a solved problem">​</a></h2>
<p>Storing blobs of data for your web application used to be more involved, I had to <em>think</em> about it. Now I don’t (much): when I build an app or website, that needs some blob storage my thoughts are:</p>
<ol>
<li>create a bucket or whatever it’s called in one of some cloud provider, doesn’t have to be the biggest name, they’re all very reliable</li>
<li>put stuff in</li>
<li>get stuff out</li>
</ol>
<p>I don’t care where much it is. Why? Because it’s a <strong>solved problem</strong>. Remote blob storage is:</p>
<ul>
<li>very cheap, and getting cheaper</li>
<li>reliable [1]</li>
</ul>
<p>At scale however, yes, you do have to think about cost, but those calculations are pretty straightforward business calculations. At anything below very large data, you don’t have to think much about it, and this makes it a <strong>solved problem</strong>.</p>
<p>It’s a solved problem in a similar way that nature has solved storing information: replication, with automated mechanisms for damage repair/reconciliation [2].</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="7998c587d99540c98564ff6646cb9977">Compute is not a solved problem<a href="https://docs.metapage.io/blog/blob-storage-is-solved-but-what-about-compute#7998c587d99540c98564ff6646cb9977" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Compute is not a solved problem" title="Direct link to Compute is not a solved problem">​</a></h2>
<p>Because you have to think about it. What I want:</p>
<p>I give you some application, some workflow, for example, a machine learning agent, some program I have created, some tool, and it requires from time to time, some level of computing power. You are able to automatically, safely, connect that application to the right level of compute resources as needed.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the program is in the browser, I might be able to use the GPU, while the tab is open and running.</li>
<li>If the program is downloaded and installed program, I have access to your entire computer, but due to that, security and parasitic programs become a problem.</li>
<li>If I make available some cloud computing, it suddenly becomes complex, with lots of decisions, but with lots of scalable compute resources of different useful types.</li>
</ul>
<p>Computing resources are inherently valuable, and often able to be converted to $$ efficiently via automation.</p>
<p>Obviously <code>storage !== compute</code> but if it were as easy, then I could distribute complex scientific simulations, and revive them years later, and they would “just work”.</p>
<p>The team at <a href="https://metapage.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://metapage.io</a> aim to solve that problem: compute as a simple commodity.</p>
<p>When we can treat compute as a commodity, we have more power over the compute providers. When they manage to get their system to be difficult to move from, you lose bargaining power.</p>
<p>Personally, I default to <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.digitalocean.com/</a>. This isn’t a paid plug! They just do a great job of making plenty of options, at the right complexity/resolution, not too many, not too few.</p>
<p>For my full stacks, I’m using AWS but not directly: my choice of platform vendor (<a href="https://nhost.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://nhost.io</a>) makes that decision for me.</p>

<!-- -->

<p>The <a href="https://archive.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Internet Archive</a> is a critical piece of the internet. By recording the past, it allows us to understand the past and therefore the future, preventing deception and allowing culture to grow and develop in deep time.</p>
<p>A critical part of the <a href="https://archive.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Internet Archive</a> is recording and preserving links. When a link to a website dies for whatever reason, but then is preserved, we keep the underlying knowledge, since knowledge is distributed, just like how awareness of the environment is somehow kept in the patterns of neuron connections, not stored someone inside specific neurons.</p>

<h1>Links that store state in the URL help preserve websites through deep time</h1>
<p><strong>The more state is stored in the URL directly, the more the website is able to be preserved and also retain functionality.</strong></p>
<p>This has a number of advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>The user state is stored in the URL and is:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>user editable (in the future)</li>
<li>machine readable</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The origin can be modified dynamically to reroute to domains that are active, without modifying the core state (in the hash parameters of the URL)</li>
<li>Much easier to store, since a URL is just a string<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Assuming that the core libraries, assets, and modules are preserved, but that’s a separate concern</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>More complex applications can be preserved as <a href="https://docs.metapage.io/docs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">metapages</a>, therefore allowing someone in the future to access a complex workflow, and use it immediately</li>
</ul>

<p>In the example above, enough code was embedded in the link to describe a 3D with a bunch of complex behaviour. Someone else can take that URL, and directly modify it, run it, then share the modified URL.</p>
<p>This way, apps can be both self-contained, but also highly configurable and shareable, allowing a high degree of direct collaboration not under centralized control.</p>
