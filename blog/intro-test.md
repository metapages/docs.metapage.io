docu-notion lets you use [Notion](https://notion.so) as your editor for markdown-based static site generators like [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). Using Notion instead of raw markdown files means that you don't have to teach non-developers how to make git commits and pull requests. It also allows you to leverage Notion's database tools to control workflow, Notion's commenting feature to discuss changes, etc.


This should be a synced block:


:::tip

Note that docu-notion is not a service that could be reading your data. docu-notion is just open-source code that will run on your computer or your CI system.

:::info

In Notion, notice that the `slug` of this page is a slash. This tells Docusaurus that this is the default document to show.
