<p>It’s hard to keep up! New tools require testing and evaluation, and while we can work to automate a lot of the evaluation, at some point humans need to experiment with and test these tools in their own workflows.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="23a018579bb58085bb67d239bf741d52">Competitions: complex tools require social-technical collective evaluation<a href="https://docs.metapage.io/blog/mesh#23a018579bb58085bb67d239bf741d52" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Competitions: complex tools require social-technical collective evaluation" title="Direct link to Competitions: complex tools require social-technical collective evaluation">​</a></h2>
<p>Academic and industry groups have used competitions to leverage our collective focus. They bring people together with both competitive fun, and collective learning. Some recent examples:</p>
<div class="custom-docunotion-row"><div class="custom-docunotion-row-cell"><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.metapage.io/assets/images/mesh.23a01857-9bb5-8069-8106-fedad0b2a017-243d14d853c9ca452f78d955ce629b03.png" width="2762" height="1244" class="img_ev3q"></p><p></p><p>rotein designers from all around the world to designed a new binding protein against EGFR, a transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in cell growth, differentiation, and surviva</p><p></p></div><div class="custom-docunotion-row-cell"><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.metapage.io/assets/images/mesh.23a01857-9bb5-8002-aa01-f9c0908b6448-4fb9a377c9cd90e144a3bf5af52637c3.png" width="1692" height="1142" class="img_ev3q"></p><p></p><p><a href="https://asapdiscovery.org/" title="null" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASAP Discovery</a>
is an NIH-funded consortium leveraging open science for antiviral drug discovery, aiming for equitable and affordable global access to  effective antivirals</p><p></p></div></div>
<p>Public competitions are an excellent way to learn from each other and channel resources. <a href="https://www.biomlsociety.org/challenge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bits to Binders</a> was another one of these kinds new challenges/competitions, and I threw my hat in the ring!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.metapage.io/assets/images/mesh.23101857-9bb5-8022-91b2-d766ea04ce62-ab5c837289fa4368284fb66808bf33c6.png" width="3052" height="688" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Myself and 4 others  joined this challenge to form a team that would generate a protein binder to a specific immune cell receptor, where a binder that would bind <em>just right</em> (not too much, not too little) would have the potential to treat some specific cancers.</p>
<p>Our team had access to GPU resources, the target, and a brand new generative AI model for protein design: <a href="https://www.bakerlab.org/2023/07/11/diffusion-model-for-protein-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RFDiffusion</a>. None of us previously knew each other, and all come with different backgrounds and experience and technology</p>
<p>However, despite our enthusiasm, our team, and many like ours, encountered significant struggles. Internally within group, we struggled to effectively share workflows and results. The organizers of the competition had done a great job to gather sponsors and organizations who collectively provided a significant number of valuable GPU resources.</p>
<p>We could only utilize a very tiny fraction of available GPUs due to both mundane and complex technical and logistical challenges. There was simply a lack of infrastructure to support this social-technical phenomenon. We wanted a vibrant community, and the organizers did an absolutely fantastic job, but the outcome of the competition specifically in respect to sharing the methodologies was hampered by a lack of suitable infrastructure.</p>
<p>Put simply, there is no universal, straightforward way to share a computational workflow that requires visualization and interactivity (due to molecular structures) also connected to GPUs running AI models and simulations, running seamlessly on whatever GPU resources are available to you. While workflow systems like Nextflow and others can be a piece of the puzzle, they lack specific features around sharing and publishing due to the inherent technical tradeoffs.</p>
<p>This missing connection means that innovation remained isolated in the groups and labs of origin, regardless of the desire to share them.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="23a018579bb580c2a6c2d2d8b3b72350">What about the competition leaderboard examples you posted<a href="https://docs.metapage.io/blog/mesh#23a018579bb580c2a6c2d2d8b3b72350" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What about the competition leaderboard examples you posted" title="Direct link to What about the competition leaderboard examples you posted">​</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://foundry.adaptyvbio.com/competition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adaptyv Bio</a> competition website looks fantastic, significant work and thought went into the design and infrastructure:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.metapage.io/assets/images/mesh.23a01857-9bb5-80d7-9625-d695eb075957-8dfdbcf827a7691f671d07b323d244f1.png" width="3228" height="1588" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<div class="custom-docunotion-row"><div class="custom-docunotion-row-cell"><p>But digging into the well-designed pages and you find that the actual design process are not embedded, and often not available:</p></div><div class="custom-docunotion-row-cell"><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.metapage.io/assets/images/mesh.23a01857-9bb5-8010-b9ce-f174c74ba82e-5cc02f1366b236c3272b1286defe9ab1.png" width="1594" height="312" class="img_ev3q"></p></div></div>
<p>And that is part of the problem. Though well-designed, the competition site is a bespoke presentation, often not containing the methods, and results that are difficult to incorporate or evaluate systematically, and in the example above, there are no methods for you to copy and test yourself.</p>
<hr>
<p>For the <a href="https://polarishub.io/competitions/asap-discovery/antiviral-drug-discovery-2025#competiton-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASAP Discovery</a> competition, for <em>some</em> entries there is code, but the <code>&lt;/&gt; code</code> link is simply to a github repository. That means a lot of custom, bespoke work to understand, and possibly use those methods:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.metapage.io/assets/images/mesh.23a01857-9bb5-806a-8bf4-ec8cf2c8cffc-f81cd9f07f3b86d663f54837910628ff.png" width="3140" height="1348" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>So in summary: you often cannot get methods and tools, and if you can the code is in a form that requires significant work just to run yourself. It’s too slow and limited, and this limits our ability to share and learn from each other, and it wastes a lot of repeated work, as everyone who wants to use a given tool has to do the same work (wasting significant effort) getting it working.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="231018579bb58024b701eb2117104dc9">MESH (Molecular Evaluation Science Hub)<a href="https://docs.metapage.io/blog/mesh#231018579bb58024b701eb2117104dc9" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to MESH (Molecular Evaluation Science Hub)" title="Direct link to MESH (Molecular Evaluation Science Hub)">​</a></h2>
<p>Recognizing these limitations, we propose a <em>socio-technical</em> initiative: MESH. Using some recent breakthroughs in <a href="https://metapage.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">publishing scientific workflows</a>, we aim to harness the very best aspects of human collaboration: shared innovation and collective learning, and in this particular space, via leaderboards of workflows. These workflows are run and expressed in the browser, even if they are only headless workflows. The workflows can be shared, modified, and run entirely in the browser, even though there are backend containers running on some grid or cluster.</p>
<p>A central part of our vision is developing the collective set of open-source tools that express workflows directly in the browser: <a href="https://docs.metapage.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">metapage workflows</a>, combined with existing proven social structures for efficient idea exploration and refinement: public competitions and leaderboards that can rapidly and efficiently evaluate and spread to target communities novel and powerful molecular dynamics software tools, in a form they can immediately use.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://metapage.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">metapages</a> platform and tools allow researchers to easily create persistent, durable, yet flexible leaderboards. These leaderboards aren't just static records; they are dynamic, adaptable workflows that researchers can easily manipulate, extend, and incorporate into their own workflows, in whole or in by parts. By leveraging a public compute grid, researchers can effortlessly connect their own or others computational resources, whether their own laptop, HPC clusters, or turn-key cloud solutions. This makes shared workflows independent of where they run (as long as you have or we provide the necessary compute resources), thus enhancing accessibility and reducing the barriers to participation and collaboration.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="233018579bb580d49e8be47c60d06c01">Example workflow in the browser<a href="https://docs.metapage.io/blog/mesh#233018579bb580d49e8be47c60d06c01" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Example workflow in the browser" title="Direct link to Example workflow in the browser">​</a></h3>
<p>Here is an example that was quickly put together to test a tool, shared among the team, that we can share with the entire world simply via a url or embedding anwhere where URLs can be: <a href="https://metapage.io/m/71990da894774ebca5a4ad2895201a5c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://metapage.io/m/71990da894774ebca5a4ad2895201a5c</a></p>

<p>The outputs of this workflow tool can be connected to other workflows, and copied with a single click, replicating all the code and data.</p>
<p>This initiative is in the house of <a href="https://omsf.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Open Molecular Software Foundation</a> whose <a href="https://omsf.io/about/mission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mission statement</a> is a succinct superset of ours. Our particular alignment is especially about accelerating progress. We envision empowering researchers of all technical backgrounds to seamlessly integrate innovations in molecular dynamics AI models developed by one group into the workflows of another, and they will be able to do this because they will be able to rely on tools that are more reliable, as the tools will have been (and can continue to be evaluated by a community. This democratization of AI tools and knowledge will unlock previously constrained collaboration potential, fueling advancements and discoveries across the molecular biology and broader scientific community.</p>
<p>We will follow up with a post about the technical differences between metapage workflows and other comparable stacks such as Jupyter Notebooks and workflow systems such as Nextflow.</p>

<p>For scientific data, long-term durability requires a model where the investor class is not the primary holder of power within the organization, as there is a rich history of investors buying companies dealing with scientific data, and maximizing profit at all costs.

<p>The most common solution is to publish a jupyter notebook somewhere. There are a number of platforms that</p>
<ol>
<li>Take a jupyter notebook</li>
<li>Run it, get the outputs</li>
<li>Convert the notebook and outputs into a static web page</li>

<p>For example, <a href="https://next.jupyterbook.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jupyterbook</a> (using the <a href="https://myst-nb.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">myst-nb</a> extension) compiles a jupyter notebook, with text and images, into a page for publishing. If you want to run the notebook yourself, you might be able to via <a href="https://mybinder.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">binder</a> or <a href="https://jupyter.org/hub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jupyterhub</a>.</p>
<p>So, it looks like this is a solved problem? Actually, there are many limitations with these kinds of solutions, and they stem from starting with something not built for the web, and bolting on pieces to make it web-friendly. It works, but it ends up being complicated, and starts to show limitations.</p>
<h1>Problems and limitations</h1>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1ab018579bb580bbb52ee2d022207cee">Problem: the content is static<a href="https://docs.metapage.io/blog/a-new-way-to-publish#1ab018579bb580bbb52ee2d022207cee" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Problem: the content is static" title="Direct link to Problem: the content is static">​</a></h2>
<p>The above platforms generate the content for a fixed, static website. There are some options to run the notebook on <a href="https://mybinder.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">binder</a> or <a href="https://jupyter.org/hub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jupyterhub</a>, but those platforms are ephemeral, and greatly limit the kind of compute instances the notebooks run on. Any data generated is lost unless specific ad-hoc steps are taken to keep generated outputs. What if I didn’t want to run the notebook on those platforms, for lots of reasons (not enough compute, storage, persistence, security), then I don’t have other options.</p>
<p>While some notebook visualizations are dynamic in some sense, as you can interact with e.g. javascript plots, it becomes complicated or limited if you want to perform computation in the final published notebook.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1ab018579bb580089277eaab89f9f7d3">Limitation: you cannot easily take all or a part of the notebook for your own workflows<a href="https://docs.metapage.io/blog/a-new-way-to-publish#1ab018579bb580089277eaab89f9f7d3" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Limitation: you cannot easily take all or a part of the notebook for your own workflows" title="Direct link to Limitation: you cannot easily take all or a part of the notebook for your own workflows">​</a></h2>
<p>Jupyter notebooks run on a single kernel, with all the visualization libraries built into the monolith kernel.</p>
<p>If I wanted to swap out one visualization library for another (e.g. matplotlib for plotly.js) it’s quite a bit of coding.</p>
<p>There’s no ability for users to publish components, and re-use those components in different notebooks. Each notebook is a monolith, unless you publish a separate library, which comes with it’s own friction and cost.</p>
<p>You don’t just publish and share code and visualization snippets for others. Instead, you have to manually copy and paste and finagle any code from one notebook to another. And everyone has this same barrier.</p>
<p>There is considerable friction in sharing and re-using notebooks and parts of notebooks.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1ab018579bb5804eb280ef88019b4d12">Limitation: a single kernel, not always containerized<a href="https://docs.metapage.io/blog/a-new-way-to-publish#1ab018579bb5804eb280ef88019b4d12" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Limitation: a single kernel, not always containerized" title="Direct link to Limitation: a single kernel, not always containerized">​</a></h2>
<p>Jupyter notebooks define their kernels, but without much automation to build those kernels. Take a look at <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/pablo-arantes/making-it-rain/blob/main/BioEmu.ipynb#scrollTo=Fk9bZi5MiD8h" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this example of a recent published model for predicting structure distributions of a protein</a>: each step requires the user input, and data is stored in Google Drive only. Interaction is via the notebook interface, so integrating the code into your own workflow is a manual process that every single person must repeat, if they want to use the model in their own workflows.</p>
<p>I would like to not have to ever manually install anything. Workflows should contain all instructions for how to build their required computation environments, and those instructions should be automated by default.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1ab018579bb5803dbbefd761cabc34ea">Limitation: you cannot easily collaborate real time<a href="https://docs.metapage.io/blog/a-new-way-to-publish#1ab018579bb5803dbbefd761cabc34ea" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Limitation: you cannot easily collaborate real time" title="Direct link to Limitation: you cannot easily collaborate real time">​</a></h2>
<p>The platforms for sharing notebooks are meant as publishing as a final step. Making it easier to publish is a good thing, but publishing is really only a step in a sequence: you might want to publish so that others might be able to use your work. This process might go back and forth, but since publishing is treated as a final step, the collaborative aspect, which is often the bulk of the work, is neglected. The final published product is not easily integrated into others workflows without significant human labour.</p>
<p>Putting a notebook in a git repository is helpful, but not sufficient.</p>

<p>So that other researchers can actually use them? Publishing your work doesn’t automatically mean it can be found. There is no one place to search for code and data and workflows, so finding code snippets or visualization relevant for your problems is ad-hoc and a manual process.</p>
<h1>Metapages: publish and embed complete scientific workflows, when you want, where you want, how you want</h1>
<p>Metapages are web-first scientific workflows.</p>

<p>Jupyter notebooks have become the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07196-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">de-facto standard for data scientists</a>. They combine code, data, and visualization, and can be shared via e.g. github. Many companies, such as <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/notebook-innovation-591ee3221233" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/scaling-knowledge-at-airbnb-875d73eff091" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Airbnb</a>, <a href="https://wiki.latch.bio/pods/getting-started#3-access-rstudio-and-jupyter-labs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Latchbio</a>, use jupyter notebooks successfully to manage their complex data needs.</p>

</ul>
<p>Jupyter notebooks grew from solving a particular set of problems, and its growth is constrained by those technical origins.</p>
<p>Notebooks are tightly coupled systems: it’s all or nothing.</p>

<p>Imagine if you could</p>
<ul>
<li>write code in any language</li>
<li>combine it seamlessly with browser interactive visualization (without complicated bridging code)</li>
<li>share and publish <em>instantly</em> with your team or audience, and know that they will be able to instantly re-run the computation, if needed, without installation</li>
<li>re-use any component that will reliable connect to your own workflow without complicated and time-consuming finessing</li>
<li>run on any computer or cluster, and never have to perform complicated setups when running other workflows</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the <a href="https://metapage.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">metapage platform</a>:</p>

<p><strong>Metapages</strong> are web-first workflows. They consist of components, that are <em>also</em> webpages. So a jupyter notebook consists of “cells” which are code blocks executing in the same “kernel” (computer process).</p>
<p>Metapage components, called meta_frames,_ are also websites. The parent page uses an <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@metapages/metapage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open-source module</a> to connect the frames via data pipes. Since the components are webpages, they can be anything.</p>
<p>For example, one component runs docker containers. A docker container can be represented as a URL, where the URL contains everything needed to defined a docker image, build the docker image, and run the container.</p>
<p>This way, components (jupyter’s cells) are completely independent of each other, and thus can be published independently, and immediately found and used by your audience.</p>
<p>They are a new way of doing data science, and we hope they will foster a new age of sharing, communication and collaboration, by removing the drudgery and making sharing code, data, and compute happen at the speed of thought.</p>

<p>Sharing code and data is the lifeblood of (data) science. Jupyter notebooks do not address this need directly, instead, you can kindof share code by publishing the notebook in a fixed repository like github.</p>
<p>And there it becomes a static artifact. You cannot share back and forth easily, or share only parts, or share data with the notebook where the data is modified.</p>
<p>Metapages are web-first, shareable with a single click, and not only the pages, but the components also can be independently shared and published. You can then embed</p>

<p>No. Metapages are closer to applications, or workflows, but they are not notebooks.</p>
<p><strong>Metapages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>are not linear (although they can be)</li>
<li>are not built to present lots of text with some visualization, rather the opposite: visualization first, text optional</li>
<li>are easily embeddable, and able to embed other tools</li>
<li>currently have less integration with tools like debuggers</li>
</ul>
<p>There will always be times when a notebook interface is more appropriate.</p>

<p>Here is a very basic simple example of what you would also do in a jupyter notebook (run some code and visualize). Unlike a notebook, it runs in the browser without needing to spin up a specific compute instance, and (unlike a jupyter notebook) you can immediately copy, edit, share.</p>

<p>The goal of the <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAIR principles</a> is to</p>
<blockquote>
<p>improve the <strong>F</strong>indability, <strong>A</strong>ccessibility, <strong>I</strong>nteroperability, and <strong>R</strong>euse of digital assets.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The principles emphasise machine-actionability (i.e., the capacity of computational systems to find, access, interoperate, and reuse data with none or minimal human intervention) because humans increasingly rely on computational support to deal with data as a result of the increase in volume, complexity, and creation speed of data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the goals of the metapage platform is to make scientific workflows instantly findable, editable, and shareable.</p>
<p>Metapages are well-positioned, as they are machine readable, using JSON to describe their inputs, outputs, metadata, and often the code is directly readable.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The POSI principles</a> are a set of goals to promote open scholarly infrastructure that guide the heart and direction of the metapage platform. Some aspects specific to our organization:</p>
<!-- -->
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="193018579bb580469aedc90c74f46268"><strong>Governance: the metapage platform will seek to be a worker owned enterprise:</strong><a href="https://docs.metapage.io/blog/posi-principles#193018579bb580469aedc90c74f46268" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 193018579bb580469aedc90c74f46268" title="Direct link to 193018579bb580469aedc90c74f46268">​</a></h3>
<p>We aim to have transparent governance, with input and visibility from our users. The goal is to eventually convert the current LLC into a worker owned cooperative, or similar structure. A cooperative structure has the best chance of long-term survival and durability, which is one of our core values: users workflows will <em>always</em> run.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="193018579bb58016884bc00ca48bcc22">Sustainability: the metapage organization aims for financial growth<a href="https://docs.metapage.io/blog/posi-principles#193018579bb58016884bc00ca48bcc22" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Sustainability: the metapage organization aims for financial growth" title="Direct link to Sustainability: the metapage organization aims for financial growth">​</a></h3>
<p>Based on services, not data or compute.</p>
<p>We specifically store data at cost, and provide computation resources, also at cost. We aim to make compute resources a commodity, so will never charge a computation “value add” beyond what it takes us to service scalable cloud infrastructure.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="193018579bb58038baade8dae8f4d2fe">Insurance: metapage resources (workflows) will always run, even if the organization is wound down<a href="https://docs.metapage.io/blog/posi-principles#193018579bb58038baade8dae8f4d2fe" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Insurance: metapage resources (workflows) will always run, even if the organization is wound down" title="Direct link to Insurance: metapage resources (workflows) will always run, even if the organization is wound down">​</a></h3>
<p>We will save user data as long as there are resources, and will enable users to take their workflows with them, in their entirety, and run them simply with a public, open-source, static browser (that users can also take and fork).</p>

<p>Metapage workflows require three things to run:</p>
<ol>
<li>A website serving the <a href="https://github.com/metapages/archive.metapage.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">standalone metapage app</a></li>
<li>A website serving the <a href="https://container.mtfm.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">metaframe container client</a></li>
<li>A <a href="https://github.com/metapages/compute-queues/releases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">metaframe container worker agent</a> running locally connecting to 2.</li>
</ol>
<!-- -->
<p>Currently 1. is the main <a href="http://metapage.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">metapage.io</a> app. If the organization is no longer functional, we will wind down and convert the domain metapage.io into the standalone app <a href="https://github.com/metapages/archive.metapage.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open-sourced here</a>.</p>
<p>You will be able to simply paste your workflows, or include the link to the definition in the URL, and the definition will be loaded.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="195018579bb58097bdadcc2bd6afa2d2">Immutable archived metapages are already a reality<a href="https://docs.metapage.io/blog/workflows-forever#195018579bb58097bdadcc2bd6afa2d2" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Immutable archived metapages are already a reality" title="Direct link to Immutable archived metapages are already a reality">​</a></h2>
<p>When a metapage is published, we store it in an immutable database that we will be available for the long term. We aim to make this archive part of a public record, with a commitment to make the public resources always searchable and available.</p>
<p>This is an ongoing effort. Contributions and ideas welcome.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s one thing to have access to data, but it’s another thing to have code <em>and also</em> a reliable, reproducible way to run the code that operates on the data. In other words, it’s not enough to just serve data, we also need principles around HOW we create compute environments that process the data.</p>
<!-- -->
<p>Data often doesn’t live on it’s own, it often requires extra tooling. For example, The Protein Data Bank <a href="https://www.rcsb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.rcsb.org/</a>: it serves various protein structures and complexes, but also has multiple ways to display and interact with the 3D structures:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.metapage.io/assets/images/fair-data-what-about-compute.19301857-9bb5-806f-bdf2-e7f51bf8b2c1-825f61188237a5872f9ae58c4da2d5dd.png" width="469" height="341" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Simply having a database serving files is not enough. Researchers need tools integrated with with data to be able to view, summarize, search, etc.</p>
<h1>Towards principles for FAIR-aligned computation</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAIR principles</a> are mostly about data, and accessing data. What’s missing is computation, or specifically, how the data is processed.</p>
<p>Ideally given some definition, a user can automatically reproduce and use a compute environment and run some code in that environment, operating on (FAIR 😀) data.</p>
<p>Since this is compute not data, the principles are overlapping, yet different:</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="193018579bb58033b274fc6868f09851"><strong>Findable</strong><a href="https://docs.metapage.io/blog/fair-data-what-about-compute#193018579bb58033b274fc6868f09851" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 193018579bb58033b274fc6868f09851" title="Direct link to 193018579bb58033b274fc6868f09851">​</a></h3>
<p>This property is not as important as for data, because compute environments are inherently ephemeral. The underlying libraries and code to build the environments must be accessible.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="193018579bb5806d8b11ecbac488a97b"><strong>Accessible</strong><a href="https://docs.metapage.io/blog/fair-data-what-about-compute#193018579bb5806d8b11ecbac488a97b" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 193018579bb5806d8b11ecbac488a97b" title="Direct link to 193018579bb5806d8b11ecbac488a97b">​</a></h3>
<p>Code and tools to build and run the compute environments must be accessible.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A1</strong> The metadata describing how to build the environment must suffice for the majority of tools and systems used to run the environments.</li>
<li><strong>A2</strong> The tools used to build the environment must be <strong>open, free, and universally implementable</strong> (e.g., Git, DockerHub, OCI registries).</li>
<li><strong>A3.</strong> <strong>Metadata remains accessible</strong> even if the code or environment is deprecated, providing references to alternative implementations or archived versions.</li>
<li><strong>A4.</strong> Where possible, compute environments are not prohibitive in resources to build unless specifically requirements dictate that necessity.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="193018579bb580d78c45f459b7311267"><strong>Interoperable</strong><a href="https://docs.metapage.io/blog/fair-data-what-about-compute#193018579bb580d78c45f459b7311267" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 193018579bb580d78c45f459b7311267" title="Direct link to 193018579bb580d78c45f459b7311267">​</a></h3>
<p>Code and compute environments should work across platforms and integrate seamlessly into workflows.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I1.</strong> The compute environments described should be machine readable, and convertible into compatible platforms (e.g. <a href="https://podman-desktop.io/docs/migrating-from-docker/managing-docker-compatibility" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">docker and podman</a>)</li>
<li><strong>I2.</strong> Code running in an environment build by one platform should run the same as an environment built with a different platform.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="193018579bb5807cb410fa8a20dddd2c"><strong>Reusable</strong><a href="https://docs.metapage.io/blog/fair-data-what-about-compute#193018579bb5807cb410fa8a20dddd2c" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 193018579bb5807cb410fa8a20dddd2c" title="Direct link to 193018579bb5807cb410fa8a20dddd2c">​</a></h3>
<p>Code and compute environments should be designed to be replicable and adaptable for future research.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>R1.</strong> A compute environment running some code can be used for running different, but compatible code. Where possible, environments can be re-used for efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<h1>The metapage platform solution</h1>
<p>The metapage organization and platform <a href="https://docs.metapage.io/blog/fair-principles">is guided by FAIR principles</a>, and we have developed an open source platform and API for representing docker containers and code as URLs:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://docs.metapage.io/assets/images/fair-data-what-about-compute.19301857-9bb5-80ec-9915-f915048ca263-ed97a3cf94bffedf7143cad05849420d.png" width="1233" height="372" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.metapage.io/blog/url-configured-websites">We like URLs encoding state here!</a></p>
<p>The URL encodes the full definition of:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>Dockerfile</code>, or docker image</li>
<li>Optionally a git repository for building the docker image</li>
<li>Optionally scripts to mount into the container at runtime</li>
</ul>
<p>We provide a worker agent the user runs on their own computer or cluster or workstation. The worker takes the docker image definition, and builds the image, then runs the code+data in the container environment. This browser client is actually a component, and can be connected to other browser components to exchange data.</p>
<p>For a complete example showing a docker container running a ML workflow and producing visual output: <a href="https://metapage.io/dion/Python-ML-Workflow-385b95ab9cb04fa7a76df627b2bde668" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://metapage.io/dion/Python-ML-Workflow-385b95ab9cb04fa7a76df627b2bde668</a></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="194018579bb580be8653efea408daf81">User experience<a href="https://docs.metapage.io/blog/fair-data-what-about-compute#194018579bb580be8653efea408daf81" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to User experience" title="Direct link to User experience">​</a></h2>
<p>As long as there is compute resources attached, users then do not have to manually install anything, or worry about their host system: the definition defined in the URL contains everything needed to reproduce the compute environment, and connectable from the browser.</p>
<p>Users can then take existing compute environments, complete with code, and directly modify, copy, and share these environments, directly as you would any other URL, or via our <a href="https://metapage.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">index of components</a></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="194018579bb5806aae41ee7529a1f9cf">How it works<a href="https://docs.metapage.io/blog/fair-data-what-about-compute#194018579bb5806aae41ee7529a1f9cf" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How it works" title="Direct link to How it works">​</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.metapage.io/docs/containers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See here for detailed instructions</a></p>
<p>We provide an open and open-source compute queue API layer, where any user can create their own secure queue, connect their computer, and run docker containers and code all defined in a single URL.</p>
<p>The URL contains the <code>Dockerfile</code>  definition, or a publicly accessible docker image, optionally code, optionally a github repository to build from.</p>
<p>This way, the mechanism to build a reproducible compute environment is simply a URL, where users simply add their own commodity compute resources (their laptop, workstation, cluster, almost anything that can run docker containers).</p>
<p>If the user wanted to run their own complete system that is different, they can, because the definition of the compute environment is encoded into the URL, thus available for all.</p>

<p>Binder is a way to create reproducible interactive single compute environments, that serve Jupyter notebooks. You can share links to your binder instance, so that others can interact with your environment</p>
<p>However, there is no state management, so every binder instance is it’s own, since the source is the github repo.</p>
<p>There is no searchable catalogue of shared binders, and binders are not composable, they are single stand-alone instances.</p>
<p>The backend is built for kubernetes, which is the largest cluster manager by far, which is good, but you cannot simply plug in your own computer easily. Kubernetes is complex, so you need to have the support of a organization or highly technical individual to implement your own.</p>]]></content>

<!-- -->
<!-- -->
<p>The <a href="https://archive.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Internet Archive</a> is a critical piece of the internet. By recording the past, it allows us to understand the past and therefore the future, preventing deception and allowing culture to grow and develop in deep time.</p>
<p>A critical part of the <a href="https://archive.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Internet Archive</a> is recording and preserving links. When a link to a website dies for whatever reason, but then is preserved, we keep the underlying knowledge, since knowledge is distributed, just like how awareness of the environment is somehow kept in the patterns of neuron connections, not stored someone inside specific neurons.</p>

<h1>Links that store state in the URL help preserve websites through deep time</h1>
<p><strong>The more state is stored in the URL directly, the more the website is able to be preserved and also retain functionality.</strong></p>
<p>This has a number of advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>The user state is stored in the URL and is:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>user editable (in the future)</li>
<li>machine readable</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The origin can be modified dynamically to reroute to domains that are active, without modifying the core state (in the hash parameters of the URL)</li>
<li>Much easier to store, since a URL is just a string<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Assuming that the core libraries, assets, and modules are preserved, but that’s a separate concern</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>More complex applications can be preserved as <a href="https://docs.metapage.io/docs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">metapages</a>, therefore allowing someone in the future to access a complex workflow, and use it immediately</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="391abf3711fb4cdc989cd95a352c95d3">Storage is a solved problem<a href="https://docs.metapage.io/blog/blob-storage-is-solved-but-what-about-compute#391abf3711fb4cdc989cd95a352c95d3" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Storage is a solved problem" title="Direct link to Storage is a solved problem">​</a></h2>
<p>Storing blobs of data for your web application used to be more involved, I had to <em>think</em> about it. Now I don’t (much): when I build an app or website, that needs some blob storage my thoughts are:</p>
<ol>
<li>create a bucket or whatever it’s called in one of some cloud provider, doesn’t have to be the biggest name, they’re all very reliable</li>
<li>put stuff in</li>
<li>get stuff out</li>
</ol>
<p>I don’t care where much it is. Why? Because it’s a <strong>solved problem</strong>. Remote blob storage is:</p>
<ul>
<li>very cheap, and getting cheaper</li>
<li>reliable [1]</li>
</ul>
<p>At scale however, yes, you do have to think about cost, but those calculations are pretty straightforward business calculations. At anything below very large data, you don’t have to think much about it, and this makes it a <strong>solved problem</strong>.</p>
<p>It’s a solved problem in a similar way that nature has solved storing information: replication, with automated mechanisms for damage repair/reconciliation [2].</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="7998c587d99540c98564ff6646cb9977">Compute is not a solved problem<a href="https://docs.metapage.io/blog/blob-storage-is-solved-but-what-about-compute#7998c587d99540c98564ff6646cb9977" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Compute is not a solved problem" title="Direct link to Compute is not a solved problem">​</a></h2>
<p>Because you have to think about it. What I want:</p>
<p>I give you some application, some workflow, for example, a machine learning agent, some program I have created, some tool, and it requires from time to time, some level of computing power. You are able to automatically, safely, connect that application to the right level of compute resources as needed.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the program is in the browser, I might be able to use the GPU, while the tab is open and running.</li>
<li>If the program is downloaded and installed program, I have access to your entire computer, but due to that, security and parasitic programs become a problem.</li>
<li>If I make available some cloud computing, it suddenly becomes complex, with lots of decisions, but with lots of scalable compute resources of different useful types.</li>
</ul>
<p>Computing resources are inherently valuable, and often able to be converted to $$ efficiently via automation.</p>
<p>Obviously <code>storage !== compute</code> but if it were as easy, then I could distribute complex scientific simulations, and revive them years later, and they would “just work”.</p>
<p>The team at <a href="https://metapage.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://metapage.io</a> aim to solve that problem: compute as a simple commodity.</p>
<p>When we can treat compute as a commodity, we have more power over the compute providers. When they manage to get their system to be difficult to move from, you lose bargaining power.</p>
<p>Personally, I default to <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.digitalocean.com/</a>. This isn’t a paid plug! They just do a great job of making plenty of options, at the right complexity/resolution, not too many, not too few.</p>
<p>For my full stacks, I’m using AWS but not directly: my choice of platform vendor (<a href="https://nhost.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://nhost.io</a>) makes that decision for me.</p>
