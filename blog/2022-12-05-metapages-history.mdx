Metapages are a way to solve problems that arose repeatedly during my work in different multi-disciplinary scientific+software workplaces.

Problems and observations:

 - the time of software developers is a limited resource
   - but collaborations produce leaps instead of incremental steps
 - it's hard to share code and complex workflows
   - but when possible, progress accelerates
 - reproducing workflows and scientific processes can be too time-consuming to be practical
   - there is a tight relationship between durability, sharing, and reproducibility
 - sometimes you want to share a piece of a complex workflow/app but it's too tied up to be practical
   - isolating chunks of code into re-usable components is as-ever very useful when possible
 - mixing backend and front-end code is overly complex for one-off workflows
   - but is powerful
 - open-source software is key


In most groups that I have been fortunate to work with, we ended up going down very similar paths, or at least, attempting to solve some of the same subset of problems.

And new technical innovations can suddently change the landscape, such as docker, where previously it was impractical to share reproducible compute environments, then rapidly became trivial.

### Metapages

Metapages solves the following set of inter-related problems:

 - How to share arbitrarily complex applications and workflows
 - Sharing and storage are interconnected: how to store ðŸ‘†
 - How to lower the barriers of creating and editing
 - How to automatically run apps and workflows in the future [deep-time-promise]










## Reference and footnotes

- `deep-time-promise`

- How to empower scientists to share their ideas
- How to add add useful tools in the places where needed
- And all this


Often, small pieces of code in just the right place is all that is needed to unblock and thus accelerate the workflow.

But make and deploying software and code can be overly time-consuming and complex.o
