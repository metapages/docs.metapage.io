# The Deep Time Promise

The promise:

metapages, or objects derived from metapages, can be dehydrated (stored) and then re-hydrated and run **forever**

:::info

A commitment to deep time is a promise to the future
:::

:::info

Individuals cannot make effective promises to the future, due to EOL/TTL, but groups and organizations can
:::

:::info

Concentrated hierarchical power in organizations leads to instabilities: personalities overrides the distributed information flow that makes up long-term agreements and values

## forever

Requires:

 - object (data blob) storage
 - DNS (serve content from addresses)
 - scientifically critical software (e.g. libraries, tools) in object storage
 - compute resources (virtual machines)

These are not something this organization can do alone: it is a long-term, multi-organization endeavour. But *with* and building on those pre-requisites, the metapages organization aims to provide the tooling and infrastructure to provide deep-time durability
