title: Run docker containers jobs
---

You can add arbitrary docker batch jobs to your metapage workflows.

:::caution
The public docker work queue service is currently for **testing**/**demonstration** purposes. Do not **publicly** share these workflows as others to run arbitrary docker containers on your infrastructure.

While these workflows should not be publicly shared, they are a very convenient way for a group of computers to be collectively utilized. 10 modern machines is a different entity compared to a single machine.
